  <h2> First AL1SC Workshop</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <p align="justify">
      The Aditya-L1 mission is India's first dedicated spacecraft mission to study the Sun. It will enable a
      comprehensive understanding of the dynamical processes of the Sun and address some of the outstanding problems in
      solar physics and heliophysics. As a joint effort of ISRO and ARIES, the Aditya-L1 Support Cell (AL1SC) has been
      set up to act as a community service centre for the guest observers in preparing science observing proposals and
      analyzing science data. This support cell provides tools and documentations required to understand, download and
      analyse the data. The AL1SC will be organising several workshops before and after the launch of Aditya-L1 mission
      to familiarize students with the basic processes happening on the Sun, current open problems, the Aditya-L1
      mission and observational data analysis so that the scientific data can be explored by a larger community leading
      to the exciting scientific outcomes. With this objective, the first AL1SC workshop will be held at ARIES, Nainital
      from 27th June to 6th July 2022.

                Solar flares are the sudden burst of energy from the Sun. The physics of solar flares is not fully understood. Solar flares are often associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) which directly impacts Earthâ€™s space weather. Hence they are the hot topic of research. <br>
                One of the primary science goals of ADITYA-L1 is to observe the solar flares and CMEs in the multi-wavelength. With both remote-sensing and in-situ instruments onboard ADITYA-L1, we will be able to study the solar flare evolution from early stages, its association with CMEs and its effect on the space weather. <br>
